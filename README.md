# Carbon `@tanstack/table` generator

This is a CLI tool used to generate patterns from pre-existing Vite templates from a monorepo to demonstrate how to use `@carbon/react` and `@tanstack/table` together.

However, this package could be used more generically to scaffold example code.

## Usage

```bash
npx generate-pattern
```

1. Select a pattern
